            <center><h2>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h2></center>
            <p>
                The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is like a language between the users computer and the main server that helps users browser and other websites talk to each other.
                When you enter a web address into users browser, HTTP requests to the websites server.
                Then the user gets information, including text, pictures, and other information, so you can see it on your screen.

            <center><h2>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</h2></center>
            <p>
                A secure version of this is called HTTPS, which keeps your information safe.
                In https, the data that is being send between users browser to the main server is encrypted, making it harder for racoons to steal the information.
                How can you know if a website is using https or http? by seeing a little lock symbol that looks like a dollar maybe too.

            <center><h2>Domain Name System (DNS)</h2></center>
            <p>
                The Domain Name System (DNS) is like a translator for the internet.
                DNS allows domains websites into IP addresses so the internet can understand and read it.
                For example, DNS translates easy to remember names like google.com into these numbers so your computer can find the website.
                Together, DNS finds the websites location, and HTTP helps bring it to your screen.</p>
